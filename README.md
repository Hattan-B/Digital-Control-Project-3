# Digital-Control-Project-3
The files of this repository are intended to be working on a Raspberry PI so that they can used to manipulate the Roomba
**Hattan Badya**

The main goal of this project is to create a publisher/subscriber to control the Roomba.
The publisher sends the six IR sensors readings from the Roomba.
The subscriber receives the IR sensors readings and control the left and right wheels for the Roomba.
